# Screen Time & Mental Wellness Risk Analysis

## Problem Statement
Modern digital lifestyles involve extensive screen exposure — social media, streaming, gaming, remote work, etc. Excessive screen time is believed to correlate with mental health challenges like stress, anxiety, depression, and poor sleep quality. This project aims to build a data-driven machine learning solution to analyze the relationship between screen time metrics and mental wellness indicators.

## Objectives
- Build a classification/regression model to predict mental wellness score or risk class.
- Identify predictive screen time behaviors.
- Develop an interactive dashboard.
- Offer “what-if” scenario analysis.
- Deploy a cloud-based wellness risk assessment app.

## Structure
- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and modeling.
- `src/`: Source code for data processing and model training.
- `app/`: Web application files (Flask/Streamlit).
